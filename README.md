# SkillCraftTechnology-WebDev-Task3
🎯 Web Development Intern | Task 3 Completed at SkillCraft Technology 🎯

Proud to share my third task as part of my Web Development Internship at SkillCraft Technology!

For this task, I built an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application 🎮 where users can play:

👤 Against each other

🤖 Against the computer

🛠️ Features Implemented:

 - Responsive UI for seamless gameplay

 - Click handling for user interaction

 - Game state tracking and real-time updates

 - Win condition detection with game-over logic

This project deepened my skills in JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and dynamic UI development. It was both a fun and valuable learning experience to work on a game that blends functionality with user engagement.
